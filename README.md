# jetbrains-settings

Lightweight plugin and feature loadouts for JetBrains' IDE suite. I use these as the default for a new project, enabling additional features as necessary. 

IntelliJ et al. can be sluggish and resource-hungry - I've found that disabling unnecessary features makes for a much snappier, more responsive experience.

These loadouts allow me to easily start with a minimal setup and build up as required by individual projects, rather than starting with every god dang useless feature enabled in a slow as shit IDE that takes forever to set up. Give 'em a try!
