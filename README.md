# jetbrains-settings

Lightweight plugin and feature loadouts for JetBrains' IDE suite. I use these as the default for new projects, enabling additional features as necessary. 

IntelliJ et al. can be sluggish and resource-hungry - disabling unnecessary features makes for a much snappier, more responsive experience. These loadouts allow me to quickly start with a minimal setup and build a toolchain as required by individual projects, rather than starting with every god dang useless feature enabled in a slow as shit IDE that takes forever to set up. The "sync settings across IDEs" feature is also phenomenonally unhelpful, so I've turfed that as a defulat. Give 'em a try!
